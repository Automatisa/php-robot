Hi!

So what is this? It is a robot written in PHP for crawl web pages.
The program can only be executed from the command line. 
You need do some configuration manually.

You will need php-curl pdo and mysql in order to run this program,
rename demo.site.config as site.config, rewrite it for your project.

There are two operations to control its running.

-run:
php PhpRobot.php standalone

-stop:
touch spider.stop
(you should wait for a moment.)

I hope the phprobot can be helpful for you.

If you have some questions, please contact me.

Cheers,
  -DJ Xu
